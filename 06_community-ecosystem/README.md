# Community Ecosystem

This directory aggregates community-driven and ecosystem-level resources around NVIDIA Isaac, Omniverse, and ROS-based robotics. It is designed as a curated entry point into tutorials, example projects, and reference material produced by the wider community, complementing the official repositories collected in the other folders.

## Included Repositories

### Awesome Isaac Sim
Community-maintained list of resources related to NVIDIA Isaac Sim and its surrounding ecosystem. This repository gathers tutorials, talks, research papers, open-source projects, and example workflows that showcase how developers and researchers are using Isaac Sim in practice.

Repository:
https://github.com/awesome-isaac-sim/awesome-isaac-sim

## Role in the Robotics Stack

This folder represents the community and ecosystem layer that enriches the core technical stack:

- Provides a discoverable index of high-quality community resources around Isaac Sim
- Helps identify real-world examples, best practices, and reference implementations
- Supports long-term learning by pointing to external material beyond this repository
- Complements the official NVIDIA and ROS repositories by highlighting how they are used in practice

As your work evolves, additional community or ecosystem repositories can be added here to reflect the tools and projects you rely on most frequently.

## Recommended Layout

The recommended layout inside this folder is:

- `awesome-isaac-sim/` – Local clone or submodule of `awesome-isaac-sim/awesome-isaac-sim`

Additional community repositories, if added, should follow the same pattern: one subdirectory per upstream repository, named consistently with its GitHub project.

## Usage Guidelines

- Treat this directory as a discovery hub for ideas, patterns, and external examples.
- Use Awesome Isaac Sim to explore tutorials, research, and open-source projects that align with your interests and roadmap.
- When you identify external projects that become central to your workflow, consider adding them here (with clear attribution) to keep your ecosystem view organized.
- Always review licenses and terms of use before reusing code, assets, or content from community repositories.

## Notes and Attribution

This directory only references community-maintained repositories hosted on GitHub. All software, trademarks, and assets remain the property of their respective owners and are governed by their original licenses and terms. The `nvidia-robotics-reference` repository is a personal reference and integration workspace that organizes selected community resources alongside official NVIDIA and ROS projects.
